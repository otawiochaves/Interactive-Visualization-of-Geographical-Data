# Geographic Visualizations with Plotly - Tutorial

This project/tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to creating interactive geographic visualizations using the Plotly library in Python. The focus of the project is to explore different geographies, including worldwide and regional datasets, and demonstrate how to leverage heat maps, pin location maps, and bubble maps to gain meaningful insights.

## Overview

The tutorial is divided into four main sections, each exploring a specific dataset and showcasing various visualization techniques:

1. **Internal Use Around the World and Continents**: This section explores global internet usage data, presenting heat maps and bubble maps to visualize internet penetration across different countries and continents. By analyzing these visualizations, we can gain insights into internet accessibility and identify regions with high or low internet usage. As an example, consider the following:

3. **Population of the United States**: In this section, we delve into population data of the United States. Using heat maps and bubble maps, we can visualize population distribution and density across states. By examining these visualizations, we can identify densely populated areas and understand population disparities across different regions. As an example, consider the following:

5. **Walmart Stores**: This section focuses on Walmart store details, including their locations and store types. We utilize pin maps to plot the store locations and bubble maps to display the quantity of stores by state in the United States. By analyzing these visualizations, we can identify geographical patterns in Walmart's store distribution and gain insights into the concentration of different store types. As an example, consider the following:

7. **Airports in the United States**: In this section, we examine the location of airports across the United States. We utilize pin maps to highlight cities with the highest number of airports, providing insights into airport distribution and connectivity. Additionally, we mark cities with two airports using red X markers on the map, allowing us to identify regions with multiple airport options.As an example, consider the following:
